Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or stop using its services. In simple terms, it's when customers leave or "churn away" from a business, often switching to a competitor or just stopping their use of the service altogether. It's an important metric for companies because retaining existing customers is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, so high churn rates can negatively impact a company's revenue and growth.
The data used in this project is a dataset obtained from Kaggle(a telco dataset).

Findings
Key factors that affect churn rate are;
Customer care quality
Cost of Service
Network quality
It is advised that:
Electronic payment method is improved/reviewed since it forms the highest churners.
Technical support system should be enhanced.
Attractive packages should be offered to short-term subscription customers to convert them to long-term. This will maintain them and reduce their churning.
Service packages should be offered to customers at highly competitive prices as possible.
